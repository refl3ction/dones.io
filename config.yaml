    content: |-
      The word DevOps is significant to me because I have strong development and operations skills. I started working as a Full Stack Developer in 2014 and migrated
      to a DevOps-focused role in 2018. I have been deploying resources on AWS using Terraform since then, creating CI/CD pipelines, and running Kubernetes in production
      environments. I helped hundreds of developers to have a better experience with operations, allowing them to deliver better software. My development skills help me a lot with those tasks.
